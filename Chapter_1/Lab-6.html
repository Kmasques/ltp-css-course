            Class Selector

            Create custom style by creating a class.  You do this by putting a period before rules, ie.:

            .headerstyle
                {
                background-color: lightgreen;
                }
            .headertextcolor
                {
                color: white;
                }
            
            then by adding it to the tags you want to affect:

                <h1 class="headerstyle">Welcome to My New Website!</h1>

            You can apply this class to as many elements and you want, regardless if it is header tag or a paragraph tag.  You can also apply more than one class to a single element, i.e.:

                <h1 class="headerstyle" class="headertextcolor">Welcome to My New Website!</h1>

                Just note that there are no periods or commas between the classes, as above.
