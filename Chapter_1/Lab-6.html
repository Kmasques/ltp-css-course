            Class Selector

            Create custom style by creating a class.  You do this by putting a period before rules, ie.:

            .headerstyle
                {
                background-color: lightgreen;
                }
            .headertextcolor
                {
                text-color: white;
                }
            
            then by adding it to the tags you want to affect:

                <h1 class="headerstyle">Welcome to My New Website!</h1>

            You can apply this class to as many elements and you want, regardless if it is header tag or a paragraph tag.  You can also apply more than one class to a single element, i.e.:

                <h1 class="headerstyle headertextcolor">Welcome to My New Website!</h1>

                Just note that there are no periods or commas between the classes, as above.


            ID Selector

            Three main differences between the Class and the ID selector:
            1.  The ID selector is only paired with one element, so you are basically going to create a specific style that is only going to one specific element.
            2.  Each element can only have one ID selector.
            3.  ID selectors have higher priorities than class selectors.  The ID selector would override the class selector within that element.

            You would use a # to indicate an ID selector:
            
            #mostimportantinfo
                {
                background-color: lightpink;
                color: darkred;
                }
            
            then in the body:
            <p id="mostimportantinfo">Phone Number: (555) 555-5555</p>
        -->
        
        <style>
            .headerstyle
                {
                background-color: lightgreen;
                }
            .headertextcolor
                {
                color: darkblue;
                }
            #mostimportantinfo
                {
                background-color: lightpink;
                color: darkred;
                }
        </style>
    
    
    </head>
