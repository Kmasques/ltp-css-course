/*
    width or height: inherit means that it will be the actual width and height of the image
    border is outside of the padding
    margin is outside of border and should be transparent.  This adds additional space so it isn't so crowded.
    The outline property uses three values to define what it looks like.  It is just for display and doesn't modify the positioning of anything else on the page.
