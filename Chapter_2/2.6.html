        <!-- Sliding door technique: this creates a button that looks great no matter how wide it will be.
            You do this by using two images. The first is a long slider, and the second is an end cap. This technique has the end cap sliding left and right only displaying or revealing as much as is needed for the text that you will be using.
            href=# you use this to scroll up to the very top of the page you are on.
