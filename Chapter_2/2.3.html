        Web fonts allow users to use fonts that aren't on their computer. Instead of using a link to your css file, you would use a link to an external website that has the font you want to use, ie:
        
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Oswald" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
        

        Check out www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_website_fonts.asp to see what web-safe fonts you can use.

        -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="2.3.css">
        <link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Oswald' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>

    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to My New Website</h1>
        
        <p class="testparagraph">This is a paragraph of sample text that we will be using to try out some different font stylings.  CSS can be used to change the look of the text on your website until it looks just how you would like it to.</p>
