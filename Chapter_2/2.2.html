        You can use the above properties to make your text look pretty much anyway you want.
        *Font-family you would use to choose the style of text. You would choose Arial, Times, etc., and then use sans-serif or serif as backup in case the computer doesn't have that fault.
        *Font-size can be made by using px or em. To use px, you would do 13px, 70px, etc. To use em, 1em is equal to 12px, so you could go up or down: .9em, 2em, 1.2em, etc.
