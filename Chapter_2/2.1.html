        <p>The Raven</p>
        <p>by Edgar Allan Poe</p>
        <p class="poem">
                    Once upon a midnight dreary, 
            while I pondered weak and weary,
                    Over many a quaint and curious 
            volume of forgotten lore--
                    While I nodded, nearly napping, 
            suddenly there came a tapping,
                    As someone gently rapping, rapping 
            at my chamber door.
                    " 'Tis some visitor," I muttered, 
            "tapping at my chamber door--
                    Only this and nothing more."        
        </p>
