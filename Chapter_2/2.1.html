        <!-- 
        *Use the "white-space:" property to adjust the white space in the text of the paragraph, and its default in normal.  Text-wrapping is the other option. 
            1.  Normal, which is the default--when using, no matter how many spaces you put in the paragraph, there will always only be one space between the words.
            2.  Other options include text-wraping:
                Pre stands for preserved, which means that it will preserve all the spaces, tabs, etc. that you have added. You also want text-wrapping, so you would use Pre-wrap, which give you everything in Pre as well as text-wraping.
        *Use "text-align:" to align the text where you want it--right, center, left, justified.
        *Text-decoration property allows for differnt effects to text--underline, overline, line-through. If you have tabs or spaces before your text and you use underline, overline, etc. those will be underlined, etc.

        <p>The Raven</p>
        <p>by Edgar Allan Poe</p>
        <p class="poem">
Once upon a midnight dreary, 
while I pondered weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious 
volume of forgotten lore--
While I nodded, nearly napping, 
suddenly there came a tapping,
As someone gently rapping, rapping 
at my chamber door.
" 'Tis some visitor," I muttered, 
"tapping at my chamber door--
Only this and nothing more."</p>
